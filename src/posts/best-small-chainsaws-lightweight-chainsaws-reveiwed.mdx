  A good chainsaw can help increase your productivity and efficiency. This is
  why we have developed this guide on the best small chainsaw options for you to
  find the one that you are looking for with ease. Understandably, it's a lot
  quieter than any other gas chainsaw. No need for anything or any fumes. It
  begins as smoothly as you like. But where can you get such an option? Here’s
  where:


  The top pick of the range has a 6300rpm brushless motor. And with this EGO power+ method, you can do most jobs. This is the [WEN 40417](https://www.amazon.com/WEN-40417-Lithium-Brushless-Chainsaw/dp/B0711Z1VSX). It is perfect for any day's use!

products:
  - name: " Chain Saw With A Lopper"
    specs:
      - name: Size
        value: 9.4 x 8.1 x 25.2 inches
      - name: Weight
        value: 5 lbs
      - name: Type
        value: Corded

        value: Electric
      - name: Voltage
        value: 120 volts

      For pruning branches into desired parts, the corded electric black decker
      lopper chainsaw is fine. With its clamping jaws, it grabs every piece and
      then slices in one quick move. Also, if you use this one, you get to leave
      work early. Since it provides branches and logs with rapid cutting.


      It's a pretty safe saw to use, most importantly. It has a rough metal guard that protects its sharp jaws. Since the guard snaps back over the blade as soon as you finish cutting, you remain healthy.


      Additionally, with this one, you get an auto chain tensioning device. And it's hardly a challenge to oil the machine. You can, however, also use vegetable oil.


      The two handles are one thing we loved about the saw. This enables you to carry the saw with both hands, offering additional comfort.


      #### Verdict


      The saw will not fatigue you much as it cuts in one quick motion. You can essentially cut most materials using a 4.5 amp motor to power the saw. No batteries are needed! That will allow you not to think about replacing any batteries. A major benefit is the auto chain tensioning system. The slitting capacity of up to 4 inches.
    pros:
      - Easy to use. No ambiguity in the way it operates
      - You may use an extended cord for long-distance coverage.
      - Cutting quickly through dense branches
      - Does not annoy you with unnecessary noise
    cons:
      - We couldn't find anything to add here really. Apart from the bottle of
        oil which comes with it. But of course, that is not part of the issue
        with the saw.

  - name: XCU02Z The Chainsaw Cordless
    body: >-
      The XCU02Z comes with an Oregon chain, which is excellent for pruning and
      limbing. All the strength you would find in a tiny chainsaw is
      lightweight, balanced, and most importantly.


      A nice addition you would like is the "tool-less" chain change as well. Without having any fancy instrument at all the chain is adapted.

      If you're a novice, the XCU02Z is an excellent option. It is also a much safer instrument, in addition to its ease of use. The chain comes to a very swift stop as soon as you let go of the trigger.


      With this one, you can even climb up a tree. Also, one-hand use is certainly not outside the spectrum of capabilities either. The switch is a one-slide. So, you slide the button on the saw to trigger it and you don't have to apply pressure to keep the saw going.


      For that individual who needs to get it correct to the nail, the saw is perfect. Its cutting accuracy is outstanding.


      This is a great saw that will not wake your neighbor up. It barely makes any noise at all, unlike a gas saw. Furthermore, it does not produce some form of scent as many other saws do.


      #### **Verdict**


      Driven by two batteries of lithium ions for long hours. The guide bar is 12 inches long. Makita developed a 1650 FPM chain velocity motor to cut through. Fewer chain changes make maintenance simpler for the instrument.
    pros:
      - Simple as well as convenient to use
      - The cordless device allows you to bring it with you everywhere. You can
        go fishing, too, and get cut
      - Zero emissions (you should enjoy this profit better!)
      - The batteries will never be a concern, as you can adjust them when
        necessary.
      - Due to the 12" guide bar, an improved cutting skill
      - Perfect top handle for limbing or pruning
    cons:
      - One issue that bothers a lot of users is the drops in the chain. You
        might find yourself having to change the chain more often than you want.
      - Although the handle is outstanding, there is still space for enhanced
        grip.
    specs:
      - name: Dimensions
        value: 12 x 10 x 11 inches
      - name: Weight
        value: 8.8 lbs
      - name: Type
        value: Cordless
      - name: Power source
        value: Powered by batteries
      - name: Voltage
        value: "36"

  ### Buying Guide


  To guide we have evaluated each option to the best of our ability to make sure you can choose with ease. Here are other things you must notice:


  #### How to find the most comfortable option:


  All you need to do is make sure the saw doesn't overheat and that it's still sharp. It also offers a strong range of safety features, including built-in safety chain brakes, to go along with its convenient use. Speaking of comfortable, it will be pretty comfortable to hang onto the rubber rear and front handle. A powerful 14.5 amp motor will make all the cuts as smooth as you would like.


  #### Top features to look at:


  The automatic chain oiler makes maintenance much simpler for you. Smooth start-ups at any moment. For months, you can have the saw idle and still start perfectly. Both blade and chain changes are less of a tool and more comfortable options.


  #### Important notice:


  We have no idea what kind of job you're going to be doing with a chainsaw. So, note that while this list is focused on hours of study, you are the only one who can determine for yourself the perfect small chainsaw!

      1. CMXGSAMA421S Craftsman


      Operationally, this gas chain saw is very strong. It's supplied with a capable engine. Perfect for a smooth and seamless experience, it offers everything you'd need.


      2. Poulan Pro PR4016


      The PR4016 from Poulan is a very good choice that can be easily mistaken due to its construction for a much cheaper saw but is a very good and inexpensive model. In terms of strength, comfort, value, and durability, it is built to be capable.


      3. X-BULL 20-Inch Chain Saw Operated by Gas


      It comes with some amazing characteristics that take away a lot of excessive load from both the user and the engine itself. This is one of the more expensive mini gas chainsaws that you can purchase, but in terms of functionality, it does not give a lot.


      4. 120 Mark II Husqvarna Chainsaw


      Husqvarna chainsaw is designed to start with a single pull quickly, this chain saw is user-friendly and developed with kickback prevention. This is a 46cc, two-cycle chainsaw powered by gas that is sufficiently consistent to generate a lot of torque to perform heavy employment.


      5. Poulan Pro PR5020 20-inch Gas Chain Saw


      The inclusion of the OxyPower motor in this chain saw will allow its consumer with high-potential to make the cuts more accurately and also consumes less fuel. It is a gas-powered 58cc two-stroke that uses less gasoline.
    ques: Who makes the best small gas chainsaw?
  - ans: In general, it is more difficult to handle a chainsaw with a cutting bar
      longer than 20 inches than a smaller chainsaw and is intended for
      industrial and technical use.
    ques: Do I get a chainsaw that's 18 or 20 inches?
  - ques: What chainsaw brand is the best?
    ans: Husqvarna and Stihl are generally considered to be the world's two best
      manufacturers of chainsaws. Any brand is likely to provide almost every
      other consumer brand on the market with superior results. Some prefer a
      Stihl's torque and low maintenance, whereas others prefer a Husqvarna’s
      rigidity and long-running period.
  - ques: Can I put on my chainsaw with a shorter bar?
    ans: Yeah, but you need a bar that's made to match the saw. But because most of
      the saws have longer bars than they need, a shorter one is hard to go
      wrong. You can get more leverage and if the bar is shorter, it is easier
      to keep the chain out of the dirt and in contact with different obstacles.
