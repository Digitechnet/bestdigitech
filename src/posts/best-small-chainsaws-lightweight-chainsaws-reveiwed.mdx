      ### 1. Chain Saw With A Lopper


      For pruning branches into desired parts, the corded electric black decker lopper chainsaw is fine. With its clamping jaws, it grabs every piece and then slices in one quick move. Also, if you use this one, you get to leave work early. Since it provides branches and logs with rapid cutting.


      It's a pretty safe saw to use, most importantly. It has a rough metal guard that protects its sharp jaws. Since the guard snaps back over the blade as soon as you finish cutting, you remain healthy.


      Additionally, with this one, you get an auto chain tensioning device. And it's hardly a challenge to oil the machine. You can, however, also use vegetable oil.


      The two handles are one thing we loved about the saw. This enables you to carry the saw with both hands, offering additional comfort.


      #### Verdict


      The saw will not fatigue you much as it cuts in one quick motion. You can essentially cut most materials using a 4.5 amp motor to power the saw. No batteries are needed! That will allow you not to think about replacing any batteries. A major benefit is the auto chain tensioning system. The slitting capacity of up to 4 inches.
    pros:
      - Easy to use. No ambiguity in the way it operates
      - You may use an extended cord for long-distance coverage.
      - Cutting quickly through dense branches
      - Does not annoy you with unnecessary noise
    cons:
      - •	We couldn't find anything to add here really. Apart from the bottle of
        oil which comes with it. But of course, that is not part of the issue
        with the saw.
