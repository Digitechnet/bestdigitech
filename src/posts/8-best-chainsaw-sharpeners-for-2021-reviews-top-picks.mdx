  Have a look at [this article](https://bestofmachinery.com/how-to-tell-when-a-chainsaw-chain-is-worn-out/) to know if your chain is worn out or not.


  This buyer’s guide will be the best guide for beginners with little or no experience since it can be daunting to invest a lot of money into a potential sharpener. It might feel like looking at the various products listed above is enough, however, to get more in touch with the technical side of things, it is imperative to go over this guide. To start, we are going to look at the main features that you should always look at, and then we will answer a few of the most frequently asked questions.


  > **Here are the important features to consider:**


  #### The Chain


  Of course one of the most important elements to any chainsaw is its chain. These can come in a variety of sizes and types and you need to pick one that is right for you. This also means that when investing in a chainsaw chain sharpener, you find one that is completely compatible with the model of your chainsaw. For a beginner, the electric sharpeners variety is probably the best as these can be adjusted. It is also easy to add different depth settings and sharpening angles.


  #### Quality of the material


  While it is not always the kind of brand that determines whether a sharpener is of good quality or not, it is recommended that you purchase a good model because the build quality can make a huge difference in the outcomes. If you invest in a good quality device initially, it saves time and costs in the long run as it decreases any chance that it will breakdown.


  You can easily choose from a wide variety of construction materials that include aluminum or hard plastic. This is entirely up to you since each user has a preference. If you want a portable model, then you might want to invest in a lightweight aluminum version but if it is not a factor, then the best in terms of durability is the metal build electric sharpener.


  #### Fixed or Portable


  When buying a sharpener, users will have two alternatives in terms of style. You can either purchase a sharpener that is portable in nature or one that is fixed. There is no real difference in the kind of cutting power they will grant the user.


  However, if portability is key for you, the most versatile electric sharpeners are handheld, and the only catch is that you might need some training to utilize these. The mounting variety is slightly on the bigger side but if it is the strong cutting capability you require, then this is the perfect model. It comes fitted with a guided sharpening angle so you get more accuracy.


  When it comes down to it, picking the right kind of sharpener depends on the model of your chainsaw but also depends on your specific job and preferences.


  Finally, it is important to look at the motor power because this is what will determine the speed of the tool that you are using. The goal is to sharpen the chainsaw’s teeth and sometimes you need precision backed with the right amount of power. To achieve these most devices range between 75 and 300 watts.


  However, speed becomes an important factor when you consider that it takes less time to sharpen your chainsaw if the device has a higher motor power rating. Keep in mind that if you do choose a higher-powered device, this will undoubtedly be more expensive as well.


  #### Conclusion


  Now that you have all the information regarding the Best Chainsaw Sharpener, It's time to choose the best one according to your own preferences. The list of unbiased reviews is designed to help you pick the right product for your needs. Other than that, we have suggested a top pick that you can choose quickly to save yourself some time with the research.
