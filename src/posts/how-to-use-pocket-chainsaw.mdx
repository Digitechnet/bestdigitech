  If you are fond of hiking or have an adventurous hobby of exploring the world, or love to go cycling for recreation. You must be very familiar with the pocket chainsaw. A pocket chainsaw, just like a regular chainsaw, is a tool to cut down the tree. The prime difference is of scale, as the name indicates a pocket chainsaw is a portable tool that you could easily carry around in your pocket. Since pocket chainsaw consists of blades and teeth on the chain, plus it comes off with the added advantage of being able to be kept in a pocket. Therefore it is illegal to carry around the pocket chainsaw casually.


  ### Difference between Chainsaw and Pocket Chainsaw:


  The basic difference between the chainsaw and pocket chainsaw is of size, their operating mechanism, and the purpose they are being used for. A chainsaw is used for cutting the trees on a larger scale whereas a pocket chainsaw is used to slash the smaller trees. Chainsaw uses the mechanism where chemical energy is converted into mechanical energy to make it work. Whereas in pocket chainsaw friction is used for slashing the trees


  ### Use of Pocket Chainsaw:


  A pocket chainsaw consists of two parts a chain with blades and handles on both ends of the chain for gripping. It comes off in a bag, where you could keep it while moving around. Now we will look at how to use a pocket chainsaw.


  A pocket chainsaw that comes with sharp blades is used for cutting down small trees, tree branches, or small wooden loges. There is no rocket science involved in using a pocket chainsaw. You simply need to get a good grip on the rubber handles with both hands. Then slide your both hands against the tree branch or other subject to be cut. This sliding will cause friction, and cut the trees. Here you are all done with successfully using the pocket chainsaw.
