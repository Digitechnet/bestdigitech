  ### Buying Guide


  Now that you have gone through our extensive reviews for products of the best battery-powered chainsaws in terms of their features and drawbacks, you might feel like you are far better equipped to make a decision. While you may feel like you know far better now that you have gone over all the options on our list, it is recommended to go over this detailed buying guide as well to get a hang of the technicalities of this device.


  This buyer’s guide will be most helpful for first-time users that have no experience since it can be tricky to decide which battery-powered chainsaw is best for you. However once you have done the proper amount of research, the choice will become easier. To start, we are going to look at the main features that you should always look into, and then we will answer a few of the most frequently asked questions.


  **Here are the main features that you should consider:**


  #### Battery


  The first and foremost feature in any battery-powered chainsaw will of course be the battery voltage because this is the entire basis for purchasing the device. Battery voltage itself won’t decide the force yield of cordless chainsaws. The best yield out of any devices has to be for lithium-ion cordless devices but thanks to such a wide variety of types such as brushless motors as well, this has pushed battery alternatives to match gas-powered ones.


  #### Electronic Safeties 


  While there is no denying that chainsaws are very useful devices, it is also true that these can be extremely dangerous if you are inexperienced or if there are no safety features set in place to balance it out. While 2 step safety lockout methods are comparatively safer for normal use, when you are atop a ladder and cutting a very tall tree’s branches, this can be a very precarious position to utilize the safety measures.

  This means that the mechanical lockout methods are not the safest to use in dangerous positions. That’s why more and more battery-powered devices are moving towards electronic power buttons which need at least 2 to 3 tries to start the device. If you are in a comfortable position and have enough experience, then some saws come with an instant power-on mode which is beneficial but thanks to the auto timeout feature, is also safer.


  #### Runtime


  The other most important element has to be the total runtime. The more work a chainsaw can perform on a solitary battery charge, the less issue you have as the time for charging is reduced down and so is the need to replace the battery.

  It has to be noted that battery and charging your device can be a real pain if you need to work for longer hours, but it is still way cheaper than having to purchase oil and mix the right ratio in.


  #### Weight 


  If you are buying a battery cutting tool, you don’t expect it to be as heavy and bulky as a gas-powered device. This is why most are lightweight and can be less than 12 pounds to a mere 15 pounds.

  Even though the actual body of the saw is pretty lightweight, it is the battery itself that adds to the overall weight of the device. This means that the batteries with the best battery tend to be the heaviest ones. However, in comparison to gas or other alternatives, these are still lighter.


  #### Conclusion


  In a nutshell, you have all the options to pick the best battery powered chainsaw. Either go with the reviews or go with our suggested top product, you can easily pick the best chainsaw according to your own preferences.


  **Now, we are moving onto the main FAQs:**

  stitle: Editor's Choice
faq:
  - ques: "What is the best battery operated chain saw? "
    ans: >-
      If you are on the lookout for the best battery pole saw, you should
      consider getting into a multi-head system. This is primarily because these
      devices offer a versatility unlike any other.

      While there are so many options that you could pick from, our favorite has to be the Stihl’s Kombisystem which is cordless and battery operated. The multi-head systems in this device are so strong that they could easily rival gas-powered contenders. The only real drawback is that this one doesn’t have the affordability that we can usually bet on for battery-powered devices.  

      However, this is a revolutionary pole saw that comes with a 12-inch bar and chain attachment which ensures that users can get more leeway than any 10-inch models.
  - ques: "Our battery-operated chainsaws any good? "
    ans: >-
      Sure some traditionalists might feel like even though it has more
      drawbacks, nothing can beat the power of a gas-powered chainsaw, however,
      now we see more of a shift towards excellent battery run alternatives
      because they are getting closer to match the power.

      They are also healthier for the environment and the user since they do not emit toxic fumes. They are just as healthy on your wallet since maintenance is easier and you don’t constantly have to buy gas or fuel. The 16 and 18-inch models are so good that they can match gas alternatives.
  - ques: How long will a battery-powered chainsaw last?
    ans: Since you are essentially using a battery, the amount of cutting the time
      you will get depends greatly on the battery itself. However as compared to
      gas or fuel charges devices, this is generally much longer. On a whole, if
      you consider use and efficiency, most battery chainsaws can last around
      one hour for total cutting time. However since nobody will work constantly
      for an hour, the chainsaw might last up to 3 max.
  - ques: "Does Ryobi make a battery-powered chainsaw? "
    ans: >-
      The short answer is yes! The brand does make battery-powered chainsaws.
      While the Ryobi brand makes a wide range of excellent and amazing
      chainsaws, their battery-powered options are some of the best in the
      business. To make things clearer, we are going to look at
      the RYOBI One+ Cordless Chain Saw which is the best one if you want to
      work around the home.

      It might not be as powerful as you would like but thanks to its new and improved Lithium plus technology, it is an updated version with an improved motor. These updates and tweaks allow it to cut twice as much as the previous models. This device is compatible with all kinds of batteries from the One+ brand so you won’t have to worry about buying new ones.
  - ques: Who makes the best chainsaw for the money?
    ans: >-
      There are loads of products you can choose from when buying a great value
      chainsaw, but our top pick for today has to be the Echo CCS-58V. This is
      true for multiple reasons. Echo is a brand that makes excellent outdoor
      tools and devices but their chainsaws are quite impressive. This is
      because the CCS is a very user-friendly model that is also effective at
      what it does and is safer as compared to others.

      However, this does not mean that it doesn’t pack a powerful punch! If you are used to using gas-powered devices then the weight, length, and torque of this machine will make you feel right at home. All that and none of the fumes and fuel issues included. It also cuts with an impressive sort of precision that rivals engine-driven saws.

      The one drawback might be that users will be a letdown that some of the important components are made of plastic. The timber spike has to be sharp enough to make the function of the chainsaw precise and accurate and since this one is plastic, it isn’t the best.
