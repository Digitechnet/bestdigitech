  ### Buying Guide - How to buy a perfect Pole Saw?


  After reading all our reviews for products of the best pole saw in terms of options and choices, you might feel like you are better equipped to make a decision especially if you love working on DIY projects around your home. While you may feel like you know what you want by looking over the excellent options on our list, it is also recommended to go over our detailed buying guide as well to make the technical side of things far easier.


  This buyer’s guide will be most helpful for first-time users that have no experience since it can be daunting to invest a lot of money into just any [pole saw](https://www.trainingfortrees.com.au/how-to-properly-operate-a-pole-saw/). However once you have done the proper amount of research, you will be far better prepared to make the choice yourself. To start, we are going to look at the main questions that you should always ask, and then we will answer a few of the most frequently asked questions.


  #### What kind of safety features does the device come with?


  When it comes to purchasing any electronic or heavy-duty heavy machinery, the most basic question that should come up in your mind is how many safety features does it come equipped with? Indeed, even experts will at times have mishaps, and when considering pole saws, you must be aware that they utilize similar cutting blades as chainsaws.


  This means that the blade you will be working with is super sharp and potentially dangerous even though it is a non-industrial device that is easily accessible to the overall population. While it may not be a lot but even buying a device that comes with an emergency stop button will make all the difference between your safety and harm.


  #### How much does the device weigh?


  Weight is another significant factor in purchasing a saw, since of course the user will frequently need to lift the instrument over the ground, and if it is too heavy, it can be damaged if dropped. For instance, in case you're attempting to chop down a tree with an instrument that is too hefty to even think about holding over your head, you'll need to attempt to point it up and this can be potentially dangerous to you as well.


  Some saws also come in lighter versions which means they can be utilized with one hand operation, therefore, permitting you to make [use](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-use-a-pole-saw-3269539) of your other hand to grab onto something else for safety and balance. Electrically-controlled saws are generally lighter than gas-controlled models since the gas varieties will need to hold their fuel inside the tank, which adds to their general weight.


  #### What kind of fuel do they work on?


  There are 3 main kinds of pole saws that users can get. The kind that is run on gas, electric ones, and of course the ones that run via rechargeable batteries. Each has its own set of pros and cons. But if you are worried about how they might be affecting the environment then the gas-powered device is a definite no.


  It is also true that gas-powered models are noisier and may emit harmful fumes, making them a less pleasant option to choose from. On the other hand, if it is unparalleled power that you desire, then nothing beats the cutting performance of a gas saw. It also does not matter what weather they are being used in.


  Choosing a device might be easier than you previously thought. This is because if you live in a more densely populated area, you might not want a gas-powered model but if you have more space between you and your nearest neighbor then gas ones will do fine.


  For battery-powered ones, if you live in a remote area, then resupplying the batteries will be a serious concern. With electric pole saws that may or may not be powered with rechargeable batteries, you will need a direct connection and even with an extension cord, you won’t be able to move around with complete freedom.


  #### Conclusion


  That said, this list of best pole saws comes to and end. Now that you have all the information you can choose your desired product from the list of unbiased reviews. Our experts also recommended one to product to make sure you don't have to spend too much time with the research.

faq:
  - ques: "What is the best pole saw on the market? "
    ans: >
      There are tons of options out there, but our top pick for the best saw
      pole on the market is the VonHaus model. This is because it is the first
      and foremost choice of most professional gardeners and specialty
      contractors. The VonHaus Hedge Trimmers are very precise and accurate.
      What truly makes it such a powerful device is that it cuts the work time
      down into half.

      Whether you wish to do the flat and vertical angled cutting, this device is the best choice. It is powerful enough to easily slice through branches as thick as 14mm thick. It is also quite lightweight which means even with extended use, it won’t put a strain on your arm or back.
  - ques: "Which is better gas or electric pole saw? "
    ans: >
      Whether you get a gas-powered or an electric device, there are merits and
      demerits to both. A gas saw might be more impressive than an electric saw
      in terms of cutting power. If the sort of trees you need to hack down is
      little or bushes, an electric saw is both more convenient and ideal. On
      the other hand, for more power to chop down huge tree trunks, a gas device
      is better.

      At the point when you think about the costs of both shaft saws, an electric saw costs somewhat more. However, over the long haul, a gas saw will be costly since it has more costs associated with maintenance and the need to repeatedly purchase fuel for it to run.

      Gas pole saws are also pretty harmful to the environment as they emit harmful and toxic fumes into the air. This can be bad as it increases your carbon footprint but also can be hazardous for humans. On the other hand, electric pole saws are more eco-friendly as it doesn’t burn through natural resources or emit fumes.
  - ques: "Are cordless pole saws any good? "
    ans: >
      There is always the benefit of uninterrupted power when it comes to
      devices that are hooked straight to a power source and this is because you
      get direct power. However, there are some restrictions. Of course, you
      will be restricted in terms of mobility and freedom since even with an
      extension, you won’t have free range to go where you want.

      Cordless poles are therefore the ideal device as they are the best ones to deal with branches ranging from three to eight inches in diameter. They are also quieter but slightly more expensive in some cases.
  - ques: Can you trim hedges with a pole saw?
    ans: While it might seem like trimmers meant for hedges and pole saws are
      similar in terms of shape and tasks, this is not the case as their
      function are very different. Of course, you can get the cutting and
      trimming of a hedge done quite easily using a pole saw, but bear in mind
      that this will not be accurate and detailed as you need to invest in the
      right kind of device for specific tasks.
