faq:
  - ques: Is maintaining an electric chainsaw easy?
    ans: "Yes, it's simple as compared to the gas chainsaws. The reason for this is
      that electric chainsaws do not need any fuel/oil changes or any refilling
      of the gas. However, it still needs some maintenance. All you have to do
      is oil the chain, clean the bar, maintain the functional cord, and drain
      the oil while keeping it back to the storage; that's it. "
  - ques: "Are electric chainsaws dangerous? "
    ans: "As the electric chainsaws are easier and more effective to use to cut the
      wood, many people prefer buying them without giving any second thought.
      These are not all dangerous to handle, but there are some chances of them
      being dangerous if they are not handled well. The reason for this is that
      they come with a sharp and fast spinning chain that may be dangerous when
      it is not handled with care.  "
  - ques: Which chainsaws are better, electric or gas?
    ans: >
      The choice of types of chainsaws purely depends upon where you are
      actually going to use them; in a wooded area, when you have to do an
      extensive cutting, then the gas chainsaws are better as compared to the
      electric ones. Electric chainsaws come in two types; corded and cordless,
      and when you compare any of these two with the gas chainsaw, cordless
      chainsaws are much easier and extremely light to handle as compared to gas
      chain saws and also from the other corded chainsaws.
