To start, we are going to look at the main features that you should always look at, and then we will answer a few of the most frequently asked questions.


  > **Here are the important features to consider:**


  #### The Chain


  Of course one of the most important elements to any chainsaw is its chain. These can come in a variety of sizes and types and you need to pick one that is right for you. This also means that when investing in a chainsaw chain sharpener, you find one that is completely compatible with the model of your chainsaw. For a beginner, the electric sharpeners variety is probably the best as these can be adjusted. It is also easy to add different depth settings and sharpening angles.


  #### Quality of the material


  While it is not always the kind of brand that determines whether a sharpener is of good quality or not, it is recommended that you purchase a good model because the build quality can make a huge difference in the outcomes. If you invest in a good quality device initially, it saves time and costs in the long run as it decreases any chance that it will breakdown.


  You can easily choose from a wide variety of construction materials that include aluminum or hard plastic. This is entirely up to you since each user has a preference. If you want a portable model, then you might want to invest in a lightweight aluminum version but if it is not a factor, then the best in terms of durability is the metal build electric sharpener.


  #### Fixed or Portable


  When buying a sharpener, users will have two alternatives in terms of style. You can either purchase a sharpener that is portable in nature or one that is fixed. There is no real difference in the kind of cutting power they will grant the user.


  However, if portability is key for you, the most versatile electric sharpeners are handheld, and the only catch is that you might need some training to utilize these. The mounting variety is slightly on the bigger side but if it is the strong cutting capability you require, then this is the perfect model. It comes fitted with a guided sharpening angle so you get more accuracy.


  When it comes down to it, picking the right kind of sharpener depends on the model of your chainsaw but also depends on your specific job and preferences.


  Finally, it is important to look at the motor power because this is what will determine the speed of the tool that you are using. The goal is to sharpen the chainsaw’s teeth and sometimes you need precision backed with the right amount of power. To achieve these most devices range between 75 and 300 watts.


  However, speed becomes an important factor when you consider that it takes less time to sharpen your chainsaw if the device has a higher motor power rating. Keep in mind that if you do choose a higher-powered device, this will undoubtedly be more expensive as well.

  - ques: "How do professionals sharpen chainsaw? "
    ans: >
      There are a few super easy steps that you can easily follow to sharpen
      your chainsaw. However, there are things you need to consider even before
      you begin sharpening. One of the most important steps is to first figure
      out what type of chain and sharpening angle specifications apply to your
      device. This can be easily found via the user’s manual.


      1. Once you have familiarized yourself with the kind of model and make your chainsaw is then the first step is to always wear your gloves and eye goggles as protective gear is crucial.


      2. The second step is to inspect the sharpening chain to make sure that it is tensioned adequately. This should be done while it is attached to the chainsaw bar.


      3. Now as we begin, make sure that the chainsaw is completely turned off to ensure there is no chance of damage or danger.


      4. Now as you begin to file or sharpen the tool, always wipe any remaining oil from the chain as this can be a hindrance as you work.


      5. Next, check what sort of damage the machine has. It may have cracked cutters and cutter top plates, be bent or burned in important areas, have a chain that is worn down. Inaccurate installation of the drive links or tie straps and even much greater abrasive damage.


      6. If the chain seems completely damaged, it might need to be replaced entirely. Finally, before you are done make sure you adjust the device’s depth gauges.
  - ans: >
      To sharpen chainsaw chains, one of the most common files are the round
      variety. This means that the standard measurement of most tools utilized
      for this task will range from 4mm to 6mm. However, since the kind of file
      you use largely depends on the model of your chainsaw, this is the first
      step before you start filing away with around one.


      Yes, you can sharpen a chainsaw using a flat file, and you can even do so by investing in a depth gauge guide that will fit right in between the cutters.
    ques: "Can you sharpen a chainsaw with a flat-file? "
  - ques: Why does my chainsaw chain keep loosening?
    ans: >
      There are many reasons why your chain might keep loosening but the most
      common one is heated. When a metal device gets hotter, it will expand due
      to the heat and this causes the chainsaw chain to become larger. This can
      be problematic because you need it to remain tight.


      Just because you are working in a cooler environment, does not mean that you will not face this issue because when the device is running, it is bound to get hotter anyways. While this may be a tiring and repetitive task, it is a fairly simple one to commit to and you might have to do it even more if you work in hotter temperatures.
